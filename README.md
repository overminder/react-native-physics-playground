### SYNOPSIS

Play with JS-based 2D physics engines and React Native.

### PERFORMANCE

Number crunching is expensive, especially on JSC's interpreter.

My iPhone 6s can at most simulate ~120 simple 2D circles simultanously
while keeping running at 60 FPS. Android devices are much worse -
My HTC bufferfly starts to drop below 60 FPS on ~20 circles.
